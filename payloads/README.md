**Payloads:**

  - Death.exe
    "Raises an error that causes a Blue Screen of Death on Windows. It does this without
    requiring administrator privileges and queries the registry for crash dump settings so that we'll have some idea 
    what type of dump we're going to generate, and where it will be."
  - Screen.exe
    "The screen melt is an effect seen when Doom changes scene, for example, when starting or exiting a level. The screen appears to "melt" away to the new screen. The
    effect is not particularly complicated. The "melting" screen is subdivided into vertical slices, two pixels wide. Each slice moves down the screen at a uniform
    speed, but they do not all begin moving at the same time, each slice given a random yet short delay.
